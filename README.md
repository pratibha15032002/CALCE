Basic Calculator:-

This is a simple, user-friendly web-based calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. It features a clean interface, handles user input from both clicks and keyboard, and includes basic error handling.

Features:-

User-Friendly Interface: A clear and intuitive layout with a dedicated display for input and results.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Order of Operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS): Calculations respect the standard order of operations.
Digit and Decimal Input: Buttons for digits (0-9) and a decimal point.
Clear Functionality: A "C" button to clear the current input and reset the calculator.
Equals Functionality: An "=" button to compute and display the result.

Input Handling:-
Responds to both button clicks and keyboard input for a seamless user experience.

Error Handling:
Detects and displays "Error" for invalid operations, such as division by zero.
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

How to Use:-

Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Enter Numbers: Click the digit buttons (0-9) or use your keyboard's number keys to enter values.
Perform Operations: Click an operator button (+, -, *, /) or use the corresponding keyboard keys.
Chain Operations: You can continue performing operations after an initial calculation without pressing "Equals" first (e.g., 5 + 3 * 2 will correctly evaluate to 11).
Get Result: Click the "=" button or press Enter on your keyboard to see the final result.
Clear Display: Click the "C" button or press Esc or C on your keyboard to clear the display and reset the calculator.
Backspace (Optional): Press Backspace to delete the last digit entered.

Technologies Used:-

HTML5: For the structure of the calculator.
CSS: For modern and responsive styling.
JavaScript (ES6+): For all the calculator's core logic and interactivity.

Error Handling:-

Division by Zero: If you attempt to divide a number by zero, the display will show "Error".
Invalid Operations: Other mathematical errors resulting in NaN (Not a Number) or Infinity will also display "Error".
Optional Enhancements (Future Considerations)
Advanced Mathematical Functions: Implement square root ( 
â€‹ ), percentage (%), exponentiation (x 
y
), etc.

Memory Functions:
Add M+, M-, MR, MC buttons for storing and recalling values


Theming: Allow users to switch between different color themes.
